# Detect-22q11.2-deletion-syndrome-using-ECG-A-preliminary-study
A preliminary study to detect Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome using electrocardiogram (ECG).

Chromosome 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome is a rare genetic disease currently underdiagnosed due to lack of widespread tests. Patients affected by this disorder may present several kinds of symptoms and clinical conditions that can heavy affect the quality of their lives, especially when not diagnosed or only diagnosed in their adulthood. The aim of this paper is to give the basis for further research on the development of diagnosis tests based on a standard ECG, a widespread clinical test already performed on children as they grow up. The results obtained on a limited set of individuals, showed significant differences between patients affected and not affected by deletion syndrome.
